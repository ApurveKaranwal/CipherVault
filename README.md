### üõ† How CipherVault Works
**1. Adding a New Entry**  
When you add a new password, CipherVault guides you through a few simple prompts:  
- **Password Length:** Choose how long you want your password to be.  
- **Special Characters:** Decide whether to include symbols for stronger passwords.  
- **Email & Platform:** Enter the email and the platform (e.g., Gmail, Facebook) for which you are generating the password.

**2. Password Generation**  
CipherVault then generates a **strong, random password** based on your choices.

**3. Quick Retrieval**  
Whenever you need it, you can **retrieve your password** by searching for the platform or email, making access fast and convenient. 

### üîí Secure Storage

CipherVault ensures that your passwords are **securely stored** in a CSV file.  
Even if someone tries to open the CSV file directly, **they won‚Äôt be able to read your passwords**, because all data is encrypted.  
This keeps your sensitive information safe from prying eyes.

### üìä Display All Entries
CipherVault can show all your saved passwords in a **clean tabular format**.  
This makes it easy to view all platforms, emails, and their corresponding passwords at a glance.

### ‚úèÔ∏è Update Existing Entry
If you try to add a password for a platform/email that **already exists**, CipherVault will **update the existing entry** instead of creating a duplicate.  
This keeps your password records organized and up-to-date.

---

### üîç Search for a Specific Entry
You can quickly search for a saved password by **platform or email**.  
CipherVault will retrieve the relevant password so you don‚Äôt have to scroll through the entire table.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Entry Not Found
If you try to retrieve or update a password for a **platform/email that doesn‚Äôt exist**, CipherVault shows a **clear error message**.  
This prevents confusion and keeps the workflow clean.

### üîê Security Notes
- All passwords are encrypted in the CSV file.  
- Do not share your local CSV file or encryption key.  
- Use strong master passwords if you plan to add one in future versions.
